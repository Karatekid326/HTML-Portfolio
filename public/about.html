<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Victor Giancola. I just started a coding course with Udemy in hopes of getting a job as a full stack developer.
<p>I am the oldest of six children. I have four brothers and a sister. I am actually the godfather of my youngest brother</p>
<p>
Some of my favorite activites include playing Baseball and Basketball and who knows
maybe I'll add coding to that list.
